## Abstract:

After a semester studying all kinds of sensers that can be used in an interactive devices, we would like to introduce a new way to play the classic Whac-A-Mole Game. This time in a simulated AR setting, the player will be able to "whack" a mole using his/her own hand as a hammer. Without any pysical contact but the player will still have a hit feedback while playing.
